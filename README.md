subgroupTree
=========

The `subgroupTree` package implements the subgroup detection and permutation-based inference procedures from [Using Recursive Partitioning to Find and Estimate Heterogenous Treatment Effects In Randomized Clinical Trials](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04164).

You can install the latest development version from github with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("molson2/subgroupTree", build_vignettes = TRUE
```

You should also check out the package's vignette for a sample use case:

``` r
library(subgroupTree)
vignette('subgroupTree')
```
